Expanse is a mod for Software Inc. that adds new software types, new company types and new personalities.

The idea behind Expanse is to enhance the experience playing Software Inc. by adding new content that is faithful to the original style of the game, as well as technically accurate and balanced.

# Contributing Translations
If you'd like to add a translation for your language, please copy the "English" folder in the Localization folder and rename it for your language (eg. German). Then, simply open and translate the 2 files ("Software.tyd" and "UI.tyd") that are in the folder. See existing localizations for examples.

To use the translation, you have to first download your respective language's translation from localizor via the in-game console command LOAD_FROM_LOCALIZOR, then restart the game to load the language translation. Type HELP in the game console for more details. After that, simply change to your language in the top left of the game screen and the mod's language will change to match the in-game language. To see languages currently on localizor, go here: https://www.localizor.com/software-inc. For more details, see this guide: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2499604205

To have your localization added to the mod, please contact me on discord. Feel free to contact me for more information or if you need help, and I will try to get back to you!
